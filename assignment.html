    <h1>Differentiate between ++i and i++ with Examples</h1>
    <h3>Answers:</h3>

    <p class="pre-increment">
      <strong>++i (Pre-increment):</strong><br>
      When the pre-increment case (++i) is used in an expression, the original value is incremented by 1 before the expression is executed.<br>
      <strong>Example:</strong><br>
      <code>
        let i = 1;<br>
        ++i;<br>
        let x = 10 * i;<br>
        console.log(x); // Output: 20
      </code><br>
      This happens because the original value of <code>i</code> has been incremented by 1 before the expression is executed.
    </p>

    <p class="post-increment">
      <strong>i++ (Post-increment):</strong><br>
      For the post-increment case (i++), when it is assigned to an expression, the original value is used in the expression, and then it is incremented by 1.<br>
      <strong>Example:</strong><br>
      <code>
        let i = 1;<br>
        i++;<br>
        let z = 10 * i;<br>
        console.log(z); // Output: 10
      </code><br>
      Here, the original value of <code>i</code> is used in the expression before it is incremented by 1.<br>
      In summary, <code>i++</code> increments after execution, while <code>++i</code> increments before execution.
